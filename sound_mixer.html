				<h3 class="textLeft teal">Overview</h3>
				<p class="textLeft">The sound mixer application was created in Unity version 4.5. I created this application after hearing that Unity 4.5 had a new feature which supported audio and video capture using the device's microphone and camera. This application is able to record the user's voice and allow them to add audio effects to change things such as pitch, speed, low pass, and reverb. Up to three recordings can be played simultaniously to create a 'beat box" effect.</p>

				<h3 class="textLeft teal">Role: Programmer</h3>
				<p class="textLeft">With a huge interest in the Unity game engine, I was excited to try out a new feature that could possibly be used for a new game. I did all the programming and made simple buttons to get the application functioning.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="textLeft teal">Process</h3>
				<p>Since I alraedy have intermediate experience in Unity, the most difficult part was working with a feature that had little documentation due to it being very new. Although the Unity website did have a few examples, they were just good enough to get by. I found out that even though it is possible to receive an audio sample from the microphone, it is -to my knowledge- impossible to directly modify its Fourier value. Luckily I found out that Unity has built in functions that can mask the sound to create these effects. Unfortunately that feature is only available in the Pro version of Unity so it may be impossible to manipulate audio samples even if you program the sound effect.</p>
