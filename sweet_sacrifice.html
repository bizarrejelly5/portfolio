				<h3 class="textLeft teal">Overview</h3>
				<p class="textLeft">Our theme focuses on isolation, depression, suicide, and compassion. The fear of interacting with society is fueled by many reasons which would easily brushed off by society as a sign of failure or danger to society. More than often, mental diseases are involved and suicide is closely tied to these conditions.</p>
				<p>The main character is visiting a friend at their hometown after having left for many years. Through exchanging emails, the friend seems to be very positive and outgoing. However, upon visit, the main character is shocked to discover that their friend had passed away. Unable to enter the apartment during day, the main character sneaks in at night to uncover clues to solve mysteries behind the true reason of death and what kind of life did their friend lead.</p>

				<h3 class="textLeft teal">Role: Game Designer and Programmer</h3>
				<p class="textLeft">With the most experience using the Unity game engine, I was tasked with putting all of our team's assets together and writing the scripts to trigger events.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="textLeft teal">Process</h3>
				<p>We used a top-down design approach to come up with our story and setting. We first decided on the theme of social-recluse and the effects it causes on people. We researched different behaviors between males and females suffering from depression and general reasons that cause the mental sickness. The information found was used to develop our character's house and their cause of death. We want to communicate the message of how people are abandoned or shunned, and that we as fellow human beings should be more compassionate towards others.</p>
				<p>Our research led us to bibliotherapy which is the use of narrative as models to understand dilemma and real-world situations. This form of interaction possesses the potential to trigger growth and healing as it allows for identification with characters and catharsis through experiencing the character's rollercoaster of emotions. After learning of the character's background, players will hopefully be able to assimilate their thoughts and address this social issue with their own conclusive insight.</p>
